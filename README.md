# Telecom Sales Data Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end sales data pipeline for a telecommunications company that provides home and business internet services. The pipeline simulates how sales data is collected, cleaned, stored, and analyzed to generate business insights.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- SQLite
- SQL
- Matplotlib

## Data Description
The dataset represents internet sales transactions including:
- Customer type (Home or Business)
- Internet plan
- Monthly subscription fee
- City
- Account status (Active or Cancelled)

## ETL Pipeline Steps
1. *Extract*: Load raw sales data from a CSV file.
 ## Key Insights (Learning Outcomes)
- Business internet customers tend to contribute higher monthly revenue than home users in this sample dataset.
- Cleaning missing and inconsistent data improves the accuracy of analysis.
- Building this pipeline helped me understand real-world ETL processes in a telecom context.
